# FS2020-Switch-Panel
A simple external switches and LEDs panel to manage some FS2020 airplanes commands

I'm a technician but i'm also interested in flight both simulated and real (Ultra Light Planes). Few years ago i bought 5 Arduino Nano to build a Star Tracker: a device capable to rotate at the same rotation speed of the earth. That project was a solution to take photos (with a long exposure) of the stars during the night.

Some months ago i bought the new Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and after a while i realized that i was having a hard time reading the status of some parameters and commands on the simulator. Consider that i wear reading glasses and compared to the old version (FS2004) some writings on the panels of the aircraft are smaller.

Furthermore, i had long wanted to try to build my own additional panel for the simulator using one of the Arduino Nano that i had in my drawer: and so i started this project that is the first and the simple one in my (two) DIYs panels for the Flight Simulator.
